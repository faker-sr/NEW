This historic Premier League showdown between Everton and Manchester United is set to unfold at Goodison Park for the final time, as David Moyes prepares to welcome his former side to Merseyside.

Everton currently sits 14th in the league standings, comfortably clear of the relegation battle, with a 13-point cushion over strugglers Ipswich and Leicester. However, they are also 13 points adrift of Bournemouth, who occupy a Europa League qualification spot. The Toffees head into this fixture fresh off a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace in their last outing.

Meanwhile, Manchester United find themselves in 15th place, 12 points above the drop zone but still a distant 14 points away from securing a European berth next season. Their most recent contest saw them suffer a narrow 1-0 defeat on the road against Tottenham.
